**Frank the Tank** is an eight week project where we're building a 2D game from the ground up. That is: no graphics libraries or frameworks – we're writing all the rendering code ourselves.

The goal is to create a simple game yet with stunning gameplay and beautiful retro pixel graphics. Know Mojang's Catacomb Snatch? If you are – well, there you go.
