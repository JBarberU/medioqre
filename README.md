# Frank the Tank

## A wave based 2D zombie shooter with portals, written in Java

**Frank the Tank** is an eight week project where we're building a 2D game from the ground up. That is: no graphics libraries or frameworks – we're writing all the rendering code ourselves. 

The goal is to create a simple game yet with stunning gameplay and beautiful retro pixel graphics. Know Mojang's Catacomb Snatch? Well, there you go.

## Game play

The game will feature a map with boundaries where the player start out. Enemies ("Walkers") will spawn in waves, and it's the player's task to clear (kill) all the Walkers in each wave, and … survive. 

As a help, the player has a couple of neat things:

- A badass machine gun
- A sneaky sword
- A couple of really hurtful grenades
- A Portal Gun!

### Why Java?
Since it's a language all of the group members know, and there are lots of resources for 2D games written in Java.
