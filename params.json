That is: no graphics libraries or frameworks – we're writing all the rendering code ourselves. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a simple game yet with stunning gameplay and beautiful retro pixel graphics. Know Mojang's Catacomb Snatch? If you are – well, there you go.\r\n\r\n## Game play\r\n\r\nThe game will feature a map with boundaries where the player start out. Enemies (\"Walkers\") will spawn in waves, and it's the player's task to clear (kill) all the Walkers in each wave, and … survive. \r\n\r\nAs a help, the player has a couple of neat things:\r\n\r\n- A badass machine gun\r\n- A sneaky sword\r\n- A couple of really hurtful grenades\r\n- A Portal Gun!\r\n\r\n## Documents\r\n\r\nFor relevant course related documents, please check the [docs](https://github.com/johanbrook/medioqre/tree/master/docs) directory.\r\n\r\n## Related projects\r\n\r\nSupporting code.\r\n\r\n- [Barber's rendering engine tests](https://github.com/JBarberU/RenderingTest)\r\n- [Barber's toolkit](https://github.com/JBarberU/Medioqre-ToolKit-V2)\r\n- [Jesper's implementation of the AStar algorithm](https://github.com/Pungsnigel/AStar)\r\n- [Chris's Audio Engine for the game](https://github.com/chrisnordqvist/FrankAudioEngine)\r\n- [Johan's \"Medioqre GitHub Notifier\"](https://github.com/johanbrook/github-facebook-hook)\r\n\r\n## We are\r\n\r\n- [John Barbero Unenge](http://github.com/JBarberU)\r\n- [Chris Nordqvist](http://github.com/chrisnordqvist)\r\n- [Jesper Persson](http://github.com/pungsnigel)\r\n- [Johan Brook](http://github.com/johanbrook)","tagline":"For course TDA367 at Chalmers University of Technology","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
